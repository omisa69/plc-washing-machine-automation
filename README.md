For this project, I developed a PLC-based control system for a washing machine using a combination of Function Block Diagram (FBD), Sequential Function Chart (SFC), and Structured Text (ST) in TwinCAT 3. The system was designed to automate the washing process by controlling water levels, motor direction, and spin cycles. The program followed a structured sequence: filling water to a predefined level, rotating the drum in both directions, draining water, and activating the centrifuge. The implementation included internal Boolean variables to manage states efficiently and allowed pause functionality using a combination of SFC and FBD. Additionally, an alternative solution was developed using ST with a CASE statement, demonstrating flexibility in control logic implementation. Debugging and validation were performed in a simulated environment to ensure the system operated according to the predefined sequence.
